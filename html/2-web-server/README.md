# Web Server

In this lesson we teach how relative links and imports are effected compared to serving directly from your machine's filesystem.

## Prerequisites

For this example, we use `serve`. There are many other web servers available, but this is quick and easy.

- Node.js

## Instructions

- Run `npx serve` in the root of this folder.
- By default, `serve` will serve your HTML at `http://localhost:5000`
- Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5000`
- Edit code, save the code, and refresh your page to see the updates!
